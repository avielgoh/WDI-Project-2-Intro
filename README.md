# Intro

## Overview

Intro is a service that introduces professionals to other professionals each fortnight. Introductions are generated by an algorithm but manually curated and registered users will receive an email from Intro each fortnight introducing them to a professional within the industry they are interested in. It is then up to the users if and how they will connect.

## Objective

Build an application with Ruby in the backend that utilises CRUD operations on an SQL database ([spec](https://gist.github.com/epoch/afbcc7148078da035cc3#file-wdi4_project2-md)).

## Technologies used

1. Ruby
2. PostgreSQL
3. Sinatra
4. Active Record
5. JavaScript
6. HTML5
7. CSS3 (including Bootstrap framework)
8. Heroku hosting

## Key features

- Users sign up and specify the industry they are currently in
- Users then specify the industries they are interested to meet people from
- Users have a dashboard to view a feed of their previous introductions as well as edit their personal details
- Users can give feedback (i.e. thumbs up or down) on their past connections (this will only be visible to the administrators curating the introductions)
- Administrators can generate a list of potential introductions for a selected user and based on that list, create introductions for users (this will automatically display on both users' dashboards)

## Features to be added

- Automatically generate an email to users when administrators create introductions from the administrator dashboard
- Add email functionality to the contact us form

## Approach / design notes

#### Fluffy stuff

I should start out by saying that this is the first website I have coded so this is going to be relatively long as I really want to document my thoughts and experiences.

Initially when I was given the specs for this project (refer to the Objective section above), I was tossing up a few options but I kept coming back to the concept of connection. I have always been fascinated by the fact that technology can facilitate real, meaningful connections between people and groups of people whether it be used to keep connections alive (such as Whatsapp or Skype) or create new and diverse connections (such as Airbnb or Meetups). For me anyway, I think that the most special aspect of these connections are that given ordinary circumstances, it would've been highly unlikely for such individuals or groups to meet.

So the brainstorming began to determine what I could build in 5 days that could help facilitate meaningful connections between people and I came up with Intro. Intro is based on the idea that a professional introduction goes a long way in creating meaningful connections. It's never been easier to find people you think you might be interested in, but it's more challenging than it should be to actually connect with those people. Intro isn't a dating site, nor it is a job search or recruitment platform, but rather it exists for the purpose of introducing individual professionals to each other where their interests align. Think of Intro as a playground - there will be people you meet that you won't get along with, however, there's also a chance you get introduced to someone that changes your life from a social, career or business perspective. That's what counts, and that's why I wanted to build Intro.

#### Planning

During my initial planning, I came up with the following user stories:
- I want to be introduced to people in industries I am interested in
- I want to be introduced, rather than have to find people and introduce myself
- I want to see a list of my past introductions, but I don't need a list of potential introductions
- I want to have the option to edit my details, and the industries I am interested in meeting people from

Further, as an administrator facilitating these introductions, I wanted the following:
- A list of potential introductions for each user
- A list of all past introductions
- The ability to create new industries and locations

I then started wireframing using pen and paper and also planning out the database structure using [Draw](https://www.draw.io/). Being the first time that I've had to plan out a database structure, I must say that I was surprised at how challenging it turned out to be. I knew the information that I needed, however, structuring the tables and respective connections wasn't easy (especially the concept of join tables and has-many-through!) but I got there in the end. After a good portion of the planning was *complete* (I use that term lightly as it never really is "complete"), it was time to start writing code.

#### Planning tips

Without going into the nitty gritty details, my tips for when you start writing code are:
- If you are planning on using a CSS framework, embrace and use it from the start for it will consume you if you try to implement it later
- If you are planning to use an API, apply early cause these things take time
- Draft routes early - it's easier to have something to work with and you can always change it later
- Focus on one page at a time - it's easy to get lost amongst the views
- Be generous with lines for `<!-- comments -->`, `# comments` and more `// comments`

#### Challenges

One of the cooler features of the app (or at least I think is cool primarily because it caused me the most pain during it's creation) is a tool that allows the administrator to select any registered user, determine all the potential introductions for that user and create then introduction. In order to develop this feature, I had to write an algorithm/function that did the following:

1. Retrieved the industries the selected user was interested in meeting people from (`interested_industries`)
2. Based on the `interested_industries`, retrieve all the users that are currently in those industries (`interested_industries_users`) whilst removing the select user if they are interested in meeting people from the industry they are already in (`distinct_interested_industries_users`)
3. Based on each of the `distinct_interested_industries_users`, retrieve the industries they are interested in meeting people from (`potential_introductions`)
4. Check whether the selected user has already been introduced to any of the `potential_introductions` (`curated_introductions`)
5. Display a list of the `curated_introductions` back to the administrator and allow them to create an introduction (which would then be automatically displayed in each users' dashboard and also prevent two users from being matched twice)

The challenge here was making sure that all the checks and data-manipulation was correct but I am extremely happy that I got there in the end.

Other challenges included:
- Forms spanning over two windows
- Accepting multiple checkbox inputs

### Design

Visual design has always been very important to me, especially when you are offering a new service and only have moments to capture the attention of potential users. The reason I chose to go for a minimalistic design on this site was that I didn't want pages, such as the dashboard, to be overly cluttered with useless information as the main purpose of the site was for a user to provide just enough information to facilitate a meaningful introduction. As such, you will notice that only the minimum level of information that a user would require (i.e. edit their current details and also see the details of people they were introduced to) has been included on the site, and nothing more. Initially I wanted to include features such as a display picture but stopped myself as these features were unnecessary as users would not be browsing the site to find connections themselves.

## CRUD operations

#### Create
Users are able to sign up to receive introductions by creating an account with the following information:
- Name
- Email
- Password
- LinkedIn URL
- Personal URL (optional)
- Location (predefined dropdown selection)
- Industry they are in (predefined dropdown selection)
- Industries they are interested in meeting people from (predefined checkbox selection)

Users are also able to provide feedback on each introduction via their personalised dashboard (i.e. thumbs up or down).

Administrators are able, via the administrator dashboard, to create the following:
- New industry
- New location
- New introduction between two users

#### Read
Users are able to log into their account to view a personalised dashboard containing the following details:
- Personal details
- List of past introductions including:
  * Preview of the introductions' profile
  * Date of introduction
  * Feedback given (thumbs up or down)

Administrators are able, via the administrator dashboard, to view the following:
- Generate a list of potential introductions for a specified user
- List of all past introductions including:
  * Preview of the introductions' profile
  * Date of introduction
  * Feedback given by each user (thumbs up or down)
- View a list of all registered users
- Find users based on the industry they are in

#### Update
Users are able to log into their account to update the following:
- Personal details
- Industry preferences
- Password

#### Delete
Users are able to unsubscribe and delete their account (requires them to validate their email)

Administrators are able, via the administrator dashboard, to delete the following:
- Industry
- Location
